# Paint and Play - Learning C++ and OOP Concepts

**Project Name:** Paint and Play  
**Language:** C++  
**Library Used:** CMU Graphics Library (2003)  
**Objective:** Solidify OOP concepts and pointer usage through a GUI-based project.

---

## Project Overview

"Paint and Play" is a C++ project designed as an educational tool to strengthen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and pointers. It is **not** a full-fledged consumer-grade paint application. Instead, it focuses on building fundamental skills in C++ while providing an interactive GUI for basic shape drawing and manipulation. The project utilizes the **CMU Graphics Library (2003)** to create a simple, window-based interface that allows users to paint shapes and move them around.

The key objectives of the project are:
- Apply core OOP principles (such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).
- Practice memory management with **pointers**.
- Create interactive elements using a graphics library.
  
While the project has painting functionalities, it's far from the sophistication of professional tools like Microsoft Paint. The core focus was **learning** rather than producing a product for end users.

## Features

- **Basic Shape Drawing**: Users can draw simple shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines using a set of predefined tools.
- **Shape Manipulation**: After drawing, users can move the shapes around the canvas.
- **OOP Implementation**: Each shape is represented by its own class, with inheritance and polymorphism enabling easy expansion.
- **Pointer Management**: Dynamic allocation and management of objects using pointers.

---

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Encapsulation**: Data related to each shape is hidden and only accessible via class methods.
2. **Inheritance**: Shapes inherit from a base class, allowing for flexibility in creating new shape types.
3. **Polymorphism**: The project demonstrates the use of virtual functions to perform operations on shapes, regardless of their specific type.
4. **Pointers**: All shape objects are dynamically allocated, emphasizing the importance of proper memory management and pointer manipulation.

## How to Run

To run the "Paint and Play" project, you'll need the **CMU Graphics Library (2003)**, which is an older library specifically used for educational purposes. Since this library is quite outdated, it might require adjustments to work on modern systems.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/besology512/paint-play.git
    ```

2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler. For example, with g++:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o paint_and_play -lgraphics
    ```

4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./paint_and_play
    ```

> **Note**: This image represents the simple user interface created using the CMU Graphics Library. As mentioned, the functionality is basic, focusing more on the C++ learning experience rather than the UI/UX.

---

## Limitations

- **Not for Consumers**: This project was created purely for educational purposes and lacks the refinement of consumer-level software.
- **Old Graphics Library**: The CMU Graphics Library from 2003 is outdated and might have compatibility issues on modern systems.
- **Basic UI**: The user interface is minimalistic and lacks the rich feature set of more developed paint programs.

## Conclusion

"Paint and Play" serves as an effective way to practice and solidify OOP principles and pointers in C++. The project focuses on building a foundational understanding of how object-oriented programming can be applied in graphical applications, making it an excellent learning tool for C++ beginners or anyone looking to deepen their understanding of OOP concepts.
